Developer Experience:
While working on this project, I gained valuable hands-on experience with the ASP.NET Web Forms framework and overall system development.
Some parts of the project were quite challenging — especially understanding the page lifecycle in Web Forms and configuring proper communication between layers in a multi-tier architecture. Getting the Entity Framework to work correctly with the SQL Server database also took some trial and error, particularly with managing relationships between customer and vehicle entities.
On the other hand, designing the frontend interface using Bootstrap/tailwind and Web Forms controls felt more intuitive. Creating the forms for adding and updating customers or vehicles was relatively easier once I understood how to use the built-in controls effectively.
Debugging was a major learning opportunity. I faced several issues related to data not being saved correctly or forms not updating as expected, which taught me how to trace logic flow, use breakpoints efficiently, and solve real-life issues systematically.

This project significantly improved my understanding of:

- Implementing multi-layered architecture in ASP.NET Web Forms.
- Managing scripts and lifecycle events on different pages.
- Creating data-driven interfaces using WebForms controls.
- Performing CRUD operations using Entity Framework.
- Structuring real-world web applications from scratch.

Overall, this project helped reinforce core software development concepts and strengthened my confidence in handling both frontend and backend responsibilities in a full-stack C# environment.
